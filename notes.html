        <ul>
            <li>
                C++ language was design with tge main intention of adding object-oriented features to C language.
            </li>

            <li>
                As the size of the program increase, readability, maintainability and bug-free nature of the program decreases.
            </li>

            <li>
                This was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or procedures(hence the name procedural programming language).
            </li>

            <li>
                As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem in a effective manner was high.
            </li>

            <li>
                Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised.
            </li>

            <li>
                Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.
            </li>
        </ul>
